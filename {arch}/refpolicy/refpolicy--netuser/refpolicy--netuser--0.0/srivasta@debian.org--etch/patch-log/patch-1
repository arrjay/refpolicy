Summary: create a net user role
Keywords: 

 This is a convenience feature. Basically it sets up a user who can
 network with generic ports, without allowing all users to do the same,
 but also without having to put special confinement on that user, and
 without making him "unconfined". The netuser role is just like a regular
 user role, but it can do unprivileged networking. Good for e.g. allowing
 only certain users to run tiny network servers like IRC bouncers.

Unless you give a user the netuser_r role, it won't have any effect
anyway. Better than using allow_user_tcp boolean, which grants all users
these rights.
