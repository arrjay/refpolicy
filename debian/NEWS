  * I've documented the process of upgrading a SE Linux system to Lenny at
    the above URL.  But I'll summarise it here.

  deb http://www.coker.com.au lenny selinux

  * To run a Squeeze kernel with Lenny policy you need to use the latest Lenny
    SE Linux policy from the above APT repository, install that and run
    "selinux-policy-upgrade" to apply it before booting the Lenny kernel.

  * If you run a Lenny kernel with Squeeze policy then you will get a large
    number of annoying kernel messages due to a minor kernel bug.  The
    command “dmesg -n 1” will prevent such messages from going to the system
    console, this is necessary for a usable console login.

  * To upgrade a system to the Squeeze policy you should run the following
    commands.  They must be run in single-user mode if SE Linux is a critical
    part of the system's security model but may be run from multi-user mode
    if your use of SE Linux is just to catch any attacks that get past Unix
    security.
