Description: Strict variant of the SELinux reference policy
 The SELinux Reference Policy (refpolicy) is a complete SELinux
 policy, as an alternative to the existing strict and targeted
 policies available from http://selinux.sf.net. The goal is to have
 this policy as the system policy, be and used as the basis for
 creating other policies. Refpolicy is based on the current strict and
 targeted policies, but aims to accomplish many additional
 goals:
  + Strong Modularity
  + Clearly stated security Goals
  + Documentation
  + Development Tool Support
  + Forward Looking
  + Configurability
  + Flexible Base Policy
  + Application Policy Variations
  + Multi-Level Security
  .
 This is the strict variant of the reference policy. This provides 
 the highest level of security, but may not be complete yet.

 This is the targeted variant of the reference policy.  In this
 variation, most of the system remain untouched, apart from a few
 targeted inter-net facing daemons, which are tightly sand boxed.

 This is the source of the policy, provided so that local variations of
 SELinux policy may be created.
