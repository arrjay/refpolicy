  * Bug fix: "selinux-policy-refpolicy-targeted: does not suggest a way to
    fix the 'maybe failing' attempt in postinst", thanks to Eddy Petrisor.
    While this does not belong in the postinst, I have addedthis to the 
    README.Debian file. This should be a low risk change. (Closes: #407691).
  * Bug fix: "Default build.conf doesn't match default strict/targeted
    policy", thanks to Stefan.The build.conf included in the reference
    source policy describe to build a policy of the type "strict". The
    default binary policies coming with Debian are build with the policy
    type "strict-mcs" or "targeted-mcs". Change the build.conf shipped in
    source to conform to what we really use. (changes TYPE=strict to 
    TYPE=strict-mcs, very low risk change.                (Closes: #411256).
  * Bug fix: "selinux-policy-refpolicy-targeted: openvpn policy do not
    allow tcp connection mode", thanks to Rafal Kupka. This bug really
    should be at least important, and we should fully support a class of
    security product like OpenVPN on machines which are running SELinux,
    and this is a very low risk change.                    (Closes: #409041).
  * Install header files required for policy building for both strict and
    targeted policies in a new -dev package, so it becomes really useful
    to work with the source package. Moved the examples from the -src
    package to this new -dev package, since the example is only useful in
    with the headers provided. This is a new package, but it contains only
    files already in the sources (No upstream changes at all), and is the
    result of make install-headers. This new package has no rdepends, and
    should be a very low risk addition to Debian.
  * This release should be a whole lot better for building local policies,
    including the policygentool for creating a new policy from scratch,
    and ability to build local policy modular packages. The build.conf
    files have been cleaned up, and the source policy defaults to targeted
    policy, which is standard in Debian, as opposed to the strict policy,
    which has priority optional.

    moving all the stamps into ./debian instead. I'll re-visit the

  * Bug fix: "selinux-policy-refpolicy-targeted: Policy for dcc misses
    Debian's FHS paths", thanks to Devin Carraway. From the bug report:
    Many of the files in these packages are overlooked when labelling
    files, because refpolicy's dcc module stipulates paths not consistent
    with the Debian FHS layout.  The files go unlabelled and dcc-client
    (at least) stops working. The two major problems  are the references
    to /usr/libexec/dcc (damons, placed in /usr/sbin by the Debian
    packages) and to /var/dcc (all sorts of things, placed under
    /var/lib/dcc).  A side effect of the latter is that dccifd_t and
    probably others need search on var_lib_t, through which it must pass
    to get to /var/lib/dcc.  Fixed the policy; will send upstream.
                                                             (Closes: #404309).
  * Bug fix: "selinux-policy-refpolicy-targeted: clamav policy forbids
    clamd_t search on /var/lib", thanks to Devin Carraway.  This is a
    simple one line change, and obviously an oversight; I think getting
    clamd to work is fairly important.                        (Closes: #404895).

    courier policy", thanks to Devin Carraway.  There is detailed
    information of the changes made in the bug report, and in the commit

    tends to get used a lot on remote mail servers, and this fixes issues
    with the policy.                                          (Closes: #405103).

    that enabling MCS categories is required for compatibility with

    CentOS 5 and above.  MCS categories is also a feature that we plan for
    all future releases of SE Linux and does not have a nice upgrade path

  * Update the module/package mapping.
  * In the selinux-policy-refpolicy-src package, now ship the
    modules.conf.strict and the modules.conf.targeted files which are used
    to build the corresponding policy packages, snce the raw modules.conf
    package has issues on Debian.
  * With this version, we no longer ship the selinux-policy-refpolicy-src
    unpacked into /etc with a gazillion conffiles; instead, we now ship a
    compressed tarball in /usr/src, which the user may unpack where they
    wish, and install policies as they wish.

  * New upstream SCM HEAD.
  * Bug fix: "selinux-policy-refpolicy-src: Compile failure of modular
    targeted policy", thanks to Simon Richard Grint. Put a wrapper around
    the offending lines to only take effect when running a strict policy.
                                                            (Closes: #384502).

    Hermann. Fixed upstream.                                (Closes: #384850).

  * Bug fix: "Needs gawk", thanks to Simon Richard Grint

  * Bug fix: "Move /etc/selinux/refpolicy/src/policy/man/man8/*
    manpages?", thanks to Uwe Hermann                    (Closes: #372789).
  * Fix errors in post installation initial policy creation process in the
    postinst. 
  * Add directories required during policy build during postinst. This bug
    prevented any policies being built when the package was initially
    installed. Also, create an empty  file_contexts.local file if it does
    not already exist. 
  * Make selinux-policy-refpolicy-targeted provide and replace the
    obsolete package selinux-policy-default; which should in the future be
    just a virtual package. 
  * Added postrm packages to strict and targeted policy packages, in order
    to clean out the directories in which files are created during policy
    build. 
  * Rewrote the postinst in perl to allow us to do module dependency
    checks, and to map policy modules to debian packages, in order to
    better detect the modules that would be necessary for the target
    machine. 
  * Also, compiling with either MCS or MLS produced errors while
    installing policy, since we lack setrans daemon. So we are now
    building with out them, created an easy to modify option to re-enable
    it later.
  * Updated modules.conf to use the latest offerings from Erich.
