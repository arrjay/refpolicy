refpolicy (0.0.20060907-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Update the module/package mapping.
  * In the selinux-policy-refpolicy-src package, now ship the
    modules.conf.strict and the modules.conf.targeted files which are used
    to build the corresponding policy packages, snce the raw modules.conf
    package has issues on Debian.
  * With this version, we no longer ship the selinux-policy-refpolicy-src
    unpacked into /etc with a gazillion conffiles; instead, we now ship a
    compressed tarball in /usr/src, which the user may unpack where they
    wish, and install policies as they wish.

refpolicy (0.0.20060907-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream SCM HEAD.
  * Bug fix: "selinux-policy-refpolicy-src: Compile failure of modular
    targeted policy", thanks to Simon Richard Grint. Put a wrapper around
    the offending lines to only take effect when running a strict policy.
                                                            (Closes: #384502).
  * Bug fix: "make: /usr/sbin/setfiles: Command not found", thanks to Uwe
    Hermann. Fixed upstream.                                (Closes: #384850).

refpolicy (0.0.20060813-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Bug fix: "Needs gawk", thanks to Simon Richard Grint
                                                         (Closes: #382821).
  * Bug fix: "Move /etc/selinux/refpolicy/src/policy/man/man8/*
    manpages?", thanks to Uwe Hermann                    (Closes: #372789).
  * Fix errors in post installation initial policy creation process in the
    postinst. 
  * Add directories required during policy build during postinst. This bug
    prevented any policies being built when the package was initially
    installed. Also, create an empty  file_contexts.local file if it does
    not already exist. 
  * Make selinux-policy-refpolicy-targeted provide and replace the
    obsolete package selinux-policy-default; which should in the future be
    just a virtual package. 
  * Added postrm packages to strict and targeted policy packages, in order
    to clean out the directories in which files are created during policy
    build. 
  * Rewrote the postinst in perl to allow us to do module dependency
    checks, and to map policy modules to debian packages, in order to
    better detect the modules that would be necessary for the target
    machine. 
  * Also, compiling with either MCS or MLS produced errors while
    installing policy, since we lack setrans daemon. So we are now
    building with out them, created an easy to modify option to re-enable
    it later.
  * Updated modules.conf to use the latest offerings from Erich.

  * Until module linking is fixed, build everything into base.
    (Sorry, this will result in a much larger policy than necessary.

  * Make modular policy actually work. Hopefully.
    (Up to now, optional_policy(`module') in base was not working upstream!)
  * Revamp build process, don't use CDBS anymore since I didn't figure out
    how to do two clean runs of the same source tree, and there is little
    benefit here without any autotools or library magic needed
